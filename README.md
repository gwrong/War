A simulation of the card game "War":

I wrote this during the summer of 2012 at Governor's Honors program between junior/senior year of high school (http://gosa.georgia.gov/governors-honors-program) where I was a Math major. I didn't know about stacks/queues but ended up kind of reverse engineering a stack.

I became interested in the computer simulation of games on a large scale, so I found it interesting to code it in Java. After coding the base game, I added in variations that were not present in the original game in order to explore various different strategies. A fellow student, Ryan Burns, helped me brainstorm ideas. We found some interesting trends and gathered data from 200 million games of War which can be found in "The Game of War Presentation" power point which is found in the War repository for now.
